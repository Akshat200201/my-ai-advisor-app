AI Conversation Log

This document records how I collaborated with an AI assistant (ChatGPT) during the development of the AI Product Advisor project. The focus of these conversations was on debugging, UI/UX exploration, and brainstorming high-end features to enhance the final product.

🔧 Debugging Together

Throughout the project, we frequently debugged issues step by step.

The AI helped identify why GitHub rejected my push when my API key was exposed in commits and guided me in cleaning my Git history.

We debugged PowerShell command errors (like Remove-Item vs rd /s /q) and Git remote conflicts (remote origin already exists).

In the app itself, we debugged where to properly place the API fetch call, how to handle process.env variables, and how to safely access environment keys without crashing Expo.

This back-and-forth debugging process saved time and ensured I followed industry-standard practices.

🎨 UI/UX Exploration

We didn’t just build functionality — we also explored creative UI/UX ideas to make the app engaging.

The AI suggested adding a polished results screen that highlights not just the product recommendations but also the “reasoning” behind them.

We discussed animations and background effects (like adding a 3D/animated background) to give the app a modern and interactive look.

It guided me on structuring components so the query input and results felt intuitive and smooth for the user.

These discussions shaped the app into more than just a functional tool — it became a polished, user-friendly experience.

🚀 Brainstorming High-End Features

We also spent time brainstorming beyond the basics.

The AI proposed integrating dynamic product explanation cards with expandable details, so users could dig deeper into why a product was recommended.

We talked about how the app could later evolve into something more powerful — e.g., adding voice input, multi-product comparisons, or even personalized recommendation memory.

These brainstorming sessions helped me think beyond the assignment and imagine how this project could scale in real-world use.

📑 Reflection

This project wasn’t just about writing code — it was a collaborative process where I used AI as a partner:

To debug problems faster.

To experiment with creative UI/UX approaches.

To brainstorm advanced features that could make the app stand out.
